## General Information
- A consumer finance company specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- It is possible to derive driving factors for the loans by segmenting the data using loan amounts

## Technologies Used
- pandas
- math
- seaborn
- matplotlib
